Hi,

My sharing is based on President Ikeda’s study lecture series:
The Buddhism of the Sun – Illuminating the World (Part 1 of 3), featured in the October edition of Creative Life.

I am sharing the following resources:
•	Document: Take 2
•	Presentation Deck: Story – Take 2 (adaptation of the same content)

Additionally, I created a separate deck titled:
Transforming Life & Environment – A Buddhist Perspective (Improvement).
After completing this, I realized much of its content overlaps with what is already covered in the Gosho study.

Regarding the slide count, I do not intend to spend more time on each slide, the word document is timed for 7 mins.

Happy to hear from you.

Regards,
Arun
